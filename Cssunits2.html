    Pixel is an absolute unit that will always have the same length no matter 
    where it will be in the document as we have talked about in our previous lesson.
    It is an absolute length that is fixed and appears exactly as that size. 

    A percentage will be based from its parents size, it will be relative to the size 
    its parent element. 

    Lets say we have here a rectangular value for our pixel 

    Lets try to give our 2 div elements some value.
